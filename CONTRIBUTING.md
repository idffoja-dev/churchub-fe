## Branching Strategy

We follow a structured branching model to keep the codebase stable.

### Branches

| Branch      | Purpose                                                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main`      | Live production environment. Never commit directly here.              |
| `staging`   | Staging environment. Fully tested code ready for production.          |
| `develop`   | Active development. All feature branches merge here.                  |
| `feature/*` | New features. Branch off from `develop`.                              |
| `bugfix/*`  | Bug fixes. Branch off from `develop`.                                 |
| `release/*` | Release preparation. Branch off from `develop`, merge into `staging`. |

### Flow

```
feature/* or bugfix/* → develop → staging → main
```

### Branch Naming

- `feature/member-management`
- `feature/auth-login`
- `bugfix/fix-token-expiry`
- `release/v1.0.0`

### Rules

- Never commit directly to `main`, `develop`, or `production`
- Always open a Pull Request (PR) for code review
- PR must pass CI checks before merging
- Delete feature branches after merging
